# Deployment
This repository contains the deployment scripts for Team 9 (Adelaide) for setting up the Twitter Analysis System.

The ControlMachine folder contains the files required by the control machine for launching the instances on NeCTAR. The user has to just compile and run the 'launchVM.py' file in that folder.

$ python launchVM.py

NOTE: The control machine has to have the Python Boto (v2.34.0) library and Ansible software installed.
