# Deployment
This repository contains the deployment scripts for Team 9 (Adelaide) for setting up the Twitter Analysis System.

The ControlMachine folder contains the files required by the control machine for launching the instances on NeCTAR. The user has to just run the following command on the command line (using Python 2.7):

$ python launchVM.py

NOTE: The control machine has to have the Python Boto (v2.34.0) library and Ansible software installed.
